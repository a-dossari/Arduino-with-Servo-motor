# Make two Servo motors move by using Arduino.

As you can see in the file, the motors and the button are connected to the Arduino board. When we press the button, the lower motor will rotate to 180 degrees and then return to 0 degree, but the upper motor will rotate to -180 degrees and then return to 0 degree.


To build the circuit, I used:

- Arduino board.

- Two Servo motors.

- One button for the Servo motors.
